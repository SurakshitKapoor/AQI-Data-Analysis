This dataset contains daily AQI readings along with metadata such as state, area, pollutants, and air quality categories. The goal is to help users analyze trends in pollution, understand health impacts, and explore differences across cities and time (weekdays/weekends, months, etc.).

Key Questions that we can explore:
How does AQI vary between weekends and weekdays?
Which cities have highest or lowest pollution levels?
Which age group or population segment is most affected (if joined with health data)?
How does air quality change over months or seasons?
Which pollutants are most prominent in each city?

We can explore this dataset using:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Power BI / Tableau
Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle
Excel for simple charts
